Hey!

As a side project enthusiast, I've developed something I think you'll find intriguing: GPTAuth.app. It's a tool designed for all of us who use custom GPT models and want a straightforward way to manage who has access to them.

Why GPTAuth.app?

Ease of Use: Simple email-based authentication.

Manage Access: Quickly see and control who has access to your custom GPTs.

I built this as a passion project, aiming to address a common need in our community. Check out the full workings in this demo: GPTAuth.app Demo.

I'm really curious to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any ideas on how we can make this even better for indie hackers like us.

Cheers!
